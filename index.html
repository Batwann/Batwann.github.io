		<p>In Pokémon&#8482; Scarlet and Violet there are four legendary pokemon called Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-lu, and Chi-Yu. The process of obtaining each of these pokemon is not easy. In order to get each of them you will need to swim across water, high jump, climb up mountains and more to only get the stakes. There are 32 of said ominous black stakes. The map below shows all of the stake locations. The stakes in each corner of the map are color coded via glow: Purple, Yellow, Green, and Blue. Each set of eight unlocks one shrine each. Each shrine houses away one of the four legendary Ruinous Pokémon — Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu.  </p>

All of them are level 60, and part dark type, the other types being grass, ice, ground, and fire for each of the Pokémon from left to right. In the image below the Pokémon are shown, once again from left to right, in the following order: Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu.
